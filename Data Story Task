# The data set that I'll be analyzing are college majors from 2015 - 2019. 
# The reason I chose this data set is to see the amount of people in which major they chose so I could research about it and decide which one I'll like to study. 
# The data set contains 8 columns, each one representing different things.

# Data Display

# The code below will be used to display out a line plot of the data set I've chosen and then will be analyzed in great detail. 

xpoints = np.array([0, 80000])
ypoints = np.array([0, 50000])

plt.plot(xpoints, ypoints)
plt.show()
